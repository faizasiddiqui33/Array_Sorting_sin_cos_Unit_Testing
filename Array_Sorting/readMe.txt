This program is used to measure the amount of time it takes to sort an array
of size 100000, 1000000 and or 100000000 depending on the input. 
The program measures the the starting time and the end of processing 
of a thread and measures this to output the time in milliseconds


We sort an array using a merge sort algorithm. 

This algorithm uses the divide and conquer technique

where the array is broken down into several 

sublists and then sorted.



The first function merge is has 5 parameters

including two arrays and 3 integers. this function

is used to merge the arrays. 

 

The second function is used to perform the sorting. 



Inside the main function, we declare three integer constants, 

these values are used to test the amount of time

it takes to sort an array of certain size.
