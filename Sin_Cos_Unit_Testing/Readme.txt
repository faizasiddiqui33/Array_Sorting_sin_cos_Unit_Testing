I have worked on VS code on Windows. 

This program calculates the sine and cosine of numbers and tests
the program using other values. The first class calculates the 
sin and cosine of 30 and 60 respectively, we then call the 
functions in another class and inside the main method, we test
the functions using the values 50 and 70 respectively. 

in white box testing, we use a range of values 

to test the functionalities of the different 

parts of the application and in this context, we 

use different range of values to test if 

the functions work well in the program. 



the declared variables int x to x6[] and int n 

are values used to test the functionalities of 

the functions. 

1. The first function int sin takes an integer x

as the parameter and returns it's sin value. 

The program first checks if x is less than zero

and assigns it a negative value. That's why we

use it's first testing value x1 to be a positive

integer and the second but the third one is a 

negative value to test how it works with the 

negative values. 



2. We use the same principle for the function cos()

except that we do not test it with negative 

values. 



3. The third function performs sin values for 

parameters from 0 to 45 that's why we used a

value within the 0 to 45 range and another value

x1 which is out of the range to see how it 

performs. 



4. We used the same for the sin45to90 function. 



5. The final function polyEval takes three values 

an integer x, an array of integers coef[] and another 

integer n. For this reason, we declared 

an array x6[] to test it.
